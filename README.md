# Game-Mod-Q2
IT266 Quake 2 Project. Aspects of a western style video game incorporated into Quake 2. 

The way to test this mod is by creating a folder for the mod in the directory for Quake 2. You can then simply download this code, extract it into the folder, and then run the mod. The actual code is everything besides the CowboyPewPew folder (thats just the models and the dll and stuff in master) 
by either creating a shortcut and navigating to the Quake 2.exe and having +set game MOD_FOLDER_NAME at the end outside of the qutoes. An example would be:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 2\quake2.exe" +set game CowboyPewPew where CowboyPewPew is the folder where my mods are. 

The common deliverables are as follows:
- **Shortcut that Auto-Launches your Mod**
- **Mod in a Separate Folder**
- **README file in GIT that explains HOWTO install and play / test your mod**
- **UI updates reflecting your Personal Deliverables**
- **Help Screen to detail how to play your mod in game**


The specific deliverables are: 
- **Change all weapons to western theme**
- Add 5 western style powerups
- Add rideable horse
- Add NPC (deputy to sheriff)
- Cut screen to have a shootout like walking back 10 paces and turn around and blah blah
